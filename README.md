## Inspiration
Creating a platform to simplify the process of crop detection and provide recommendations for any problems found.

<div id="#usecase">

## ⚙ What it does - 
- Simplifies the process of crop detection and analysis
- Provides recommendations for problems found in crops
- Utilizes various tools and technologies to enhance the user experience e.g Flutter and Gemini AI.

## 🔧 How we built it-
1. Utilized the Gemini AI API for crop detection and recommendation
2. The frontend consumes this API to display the results to the user
3. Integrated tools like Gemini AI for crop analysis and Twilio for notifications, and Flutter for Mobile App Development.

## 💪 Challenges we ran into -
Time constraints and learning new technologies on the go

## 📌 Accomplishments that we're proud of -
Successfully integrating Gemini AI and Flutter technologies into a cohesive platform

## 📚 What we learned -
We learned about crop detection, AI integration, and effective use of APIs

## ⏭ What's next for -
Improving the recommendation system and adding more features for crop analysis
Adding more information to the knowledge base to increase detection efficiency
